    "There are various methods of parameterizing the classification variables. **Two common parameterization methods, or coding schemes, are effect coding and reference cell coding.** Different parameterization methods will produce the same results regarding the significance of the categorical predictors. But understanding the parameterization method will help you to interpret your results accurately. The CLASS statement specifies which parameterization method PROC LOGISTIC uses. By default, PROC LOGISTIC uses effect coding. If you specify only a variable in the CLASS statement, as in this example, PROC LOGISTIC uses effect coding. To specify a parameterization method other than the default, such as reference cell coding, you use the PARAM= option in the CLASS statement. The keyword for reference cell coding is either REFERENCE or REF, as in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the default reference level for either effect coding or reference cell coding, **PROC LOGISTIC uses the level that has the highest ranked value—or, the last value—when the levels are sorted in ascending alphanumeric order.** In this example, for Gender, Male is the default reference level. If you want to specify a reference level, you use the REF= variable option. You can specify the actual value (or level) in quotation marks or the keyword FIRST or LAST. In this example, for the classification variable Gender, the REF= option specifies Male as the reference level. In this example, Male is the default reference level, so it's not necessary to specify it. However, including the REF= option makes your code easier to understand at a glance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Effect coding compares the effect of each level of the variable to the average effect of all levels. For effect coding, the p-values indicate whether each particular level is significant compared to the average effect of all levels. The p-value for IncLevel 1 is 0.1273, which indicates that the effect of low income is no different than the average effect of low, medium, and high income. \n",

The reference level is the intercept.\n",

Instead, $\\beta_{0}$ is the value of the logit of the probability when income is high (or at the reference level). $\\beta_{1}$ is the difference between the logit of the probability for low and high income. $\\beta_{2}$ is the difference between the logit of the probability for medium and high income.\n",

AIC and SC are goodness-of-fit measures that you can use to compare one model to another. AIC and SC are not dependent on the number of terms in the model. For both AIC and SC, lower values indicate a more desirable model. **AIC adjusts for the number of predictor variables, and SC adjusts for the number of predictor variables and the number of observations. SC uses a bigger penalty for extra variables and therefore favors more parsimonious models. If you are trying to come up with the best explanatory model, AIC is the best of the three statistics to use.

We know that customers have a different predicted probability of spending the target amount, based on their gender. A man has a lower predicted probability (0.32) and a woman has a higher predicted probability (0.42) of spending that amount. In this pair, the woman spent the higher amount and the man did not, as the model predicts. **A pair is concordant if the model predicts it correctly. In other words, a pair is concordant if the observation with the desired outcome has a higher predicted probability, based on the model, than the observation without the outcome.** \n",

From our model, we know that a woman has a higher predicted probability (0.42) and a man has a lower predicted probability (0.32) of spending $100 or more. However, in this pair, the man spent $100 or more but the woman did not. Our model did not predict this pair correctly, so it is a discordant pair. **A pair is discordant if the observation with the desired outcome has a lower predicted probability than the observation without the outcome.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at one more pair, which consists of a woman from each group. According to our model, both have a predicted probability of 0.42 of spending $100 or more, so our model cannot distinguish between them. **A pair is tied if it is neither concordant nor discordant—the probabilities are the same.** In this example, a tied pair can consist of either two women or two men. Either way, the probabilities are the same and the model cannot distinguish between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This table summarizes the combinations that make up the three types of pairs in this analysis. When a pair consists of a female from the group of customers with the desired outcome and a male from the group of customers without the outcome, then the pair is concordant. The pair fits the model. When a pair consists of a male from the group of customers with the desired outcome and a female from the group of customers without the outcome, then the pair is discordant. The pair does not fit the model. When a pair consists of either two males or two females, they have the same predicted probability, and the pair is tied. The predictor variable Gender has only two levels, so there are only two predicted probabilities for the outcome of purchasing \\$100 or more. More complex models have more than two predicted probabilities. However, regardless of the model's complexity, the same comparisons are made across all pairs of observations with different outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another look at the Association of Predicted Probabilities and Observed Responses table. The left column lists the percentage of pairs of each type: concordant, discordant, and tied. At the bottom is the total number of observation pairs on which the percentages are based. In this example, there are 43,578 pairs of observations with different outcome values. The frequency table for Purchase that we generated in an earlier demonstration shows where the total number of pairs comes from. The data set contains 162 observations with an outcome of \\$100 dollars or more and 269 observations with an outcome of under \\$100 dollars. We multiply 162 by 269 to get 43,578 pairs of observations that have different outcome values. You can use the percentages of concordant, discordant, and tied pairs as goodness‑of‑fit measures to compare one model to another. In general, higher percentages of concordant pairs and lower percentages of discordant and tied pairs indicate a more desirable model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This table also shows the four rank correlation indices that are computed from the numbers of concordant, discordant, and tied pairs of observations: Somers' D, Gamma, Tau-a, and c. In general, a model with higher values for these indices has better predictive ability than a model with lower values. Of these indices, c is the most commonly used. The concordance index, c, estimates the probability of an observation with the desired outcome having a higher predicted probability than an observation without the desired outcome. C is calculated as the number concordant outcomes plus ½ times the number of ties divided by the total number of pairs.\n",

    "When only significant interactions remain, PROC LOGISTIC turns its attention to the main effects. PROC LOGISTIC eliminates, one at a time, the nonsignificant main effects that are not involved in any significant interactions. Each time, PROC LOGISTIC eliminates the least significant interaction—the one with the largest p-value. When eliminating main effects, PROC LOGISTIC must preserve the model hierarchy. According to this requirement, for any interaction that's included in the model, all main effects that the interaction contains must also be in the model. For example, the interaction Gender by IncLevel is significant and has remained in the model, so both Gender and IncLevel must also remain in the model, whether or not they are significant. The only main effect that PROC LOGISTIC could possibly eliminate is Age, and only if Age is nonsignificant. \n",
