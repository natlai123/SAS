    "## Pearson Chi-Square Test of Association\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with the **null hypothesis of no association** between the variables and the alternative hypothesis of association. To determine whether there is an association, the Pearson chi-square test measures the difference between the observed cell frequencies and the cell frequencies that are expected if there is no association between the variables. In other words, the expected frequencies are the frequencies you expect to get if the null hypothesis is true. The chi-square test calculates the expected frequencies for each cell by multiplying the row total (R) by the column total (C), and then dividing the result by the total sample size (T). If the observed frequencies equal the expected frequencies, there is no association between the variables. If the observed frequencies do not equal the expected frequencies, there is an association between the variables. The chi-square statistic indicates the difference between observed frequencies and expected frequencies. A significant chi-square statistic is strong evidence that an association exists between your variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the chi-square statistic and its corresponding p-value indicate only whether an association exists between two categorical variables. The p-value indicates how confident you can be that the null hypothesis of no association is false. However, neither the chi-square statistic nor its p-value tells you the magnitude of an association. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chi-square statistics and their p-values depend on and reflect the sample size. A larger sample size yields a larger chi-square statistic and a smaller corresponding p-value, even though the association might not be all that strong. For example, if you double the size of your sample by duplicating each observation, you double the value of the chi‑square statistic, even though the strength of the association does not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cramer's V Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "Cramer's V statistic is one measure of the strength of an association between two categorical variables. Cramer's V statistic is derived from the Pearson chi-square statistic. \n",
    "\n",
    "For two-by-two tables, Cramer's V is in the range of -1 to 1. For larger tables, Cramer's V is in the range of 0 to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Values farther away from 0 indicate a relatively strong association between the variables. The closer Cramer's V is to 0, the weaker the association is between the rows and columns. For a two-by-two table, a Cramer's V value close to 1 indicates a strong positive association. A Cramer's V value close to -1 shows a strong negative association. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like other measures of strength of association, Cramer's V statistic is not affected by sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Odd Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "$${\\displaystyle \\mathrm {OR} ={\\frac {\\operatorname {odds} (x+1)}{\\operatorname {odds} (x)}}={\\frac {\\left({\\frac {F(x+1)}{1-F(x+1)}}\\right)}{\\left({\\frac {F(x)}{1-F(x)}}\\right)}}={\\frac {e^{\\beta _{0}+\\beta _{1}(x+1)}}{e^{\\beta _{0}+\\beta _{1}x}}}=e^{\\beta _{1}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the strength of the association between a binary predictor variable and a binary outcome variable, you can use an odds ratio. An odds ratio indicates how much more likely it is, with respect to odds, that a certain event, or outcome, occurs in one group relative to its occurrence in another group. In this example, you want to know how much more likely it is, with respect to odds, that a Yes outcome occurs in Group B relative to its occurrence in Group A. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know the probabilities, let's calculate the odds. The odds of the outcome occurring in Group B are the probability of a Yes outcome in Group B (.90) divided by the probability of a No outcome in Group B (.10). The odds for group B are 9 (or 9:1), which means that we expect nine occurrences of the outcome to one non-occurrence in Group B. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a question: What are the odds of having the outcome in Group A? To calculate the odds of the outcome occurring in Group A, you divide the probability of a Yes outcome in Group A (.75) by the probability of a No outcome in Group A (.25). **The odds for Group A are 3 (or 3:1), which means that you expect three times as many occurrences as non-occurrences in Group A.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know the odds of the outcome in both groups, you can compare the Group B odds with the Group A odds by calculating an odds ratio. You divide the odds of an outcome in Group B (9) by the odds of an outcome in Group A (3), with a result of 3. An odds ratio of 3 means that the odds of getting the outcome in Group B are three times those of getting the outcome in Group A. In this example, the odds of saving at least 10% of income are three times higher for people who have received training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the possible range of values for an odds ratio. The value of the odds ratio can range from 0 to infinity; it cannot be negative. When the odds ratio is 1, there is no association between the predictor variable and the outcome variable. If the odds ratio is greater than 1, the group in the numerator of the fraction (here, Group B) is more likely to have the outcome. In the example about saving money, the odds ratio 3 indicates that the odds for Group B is three times the odds for Group A. If the odds ratio is less than 1, the group in the denominator of the fraction (here, Group A) is more likely to have the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "The odds ratio is approximately the same regardless of sample size. To estimate the true odds ratio while taking into account the variability of the sample statistic, you can calculate confidence intervals just as you can for any unknown parameter you are trying to estimate. A 95% confidence interval for an odds ratio means that you are 95% confident that the interval contains the true odds ratio. In other words, if you sample repeatedly and calculate a confidence interval for each sample odds ratio, 95% of the time your confidence interval will contain the true population odds ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use an odds ratio to test for significance between two categorical variables. **If the 95% confidence interval does not include 1, the odds ratio is significant at the 0.05 level. You are 95% confident that the true odds ratio is significantly different from 1. There is an association between the two variables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The last table below shows estimates of the relative risk for the row 1 variable to the row 2 variable in the crosstabulation table above. The RELRISK option generates this table. In the Estimates of the Relative Risk table, the odds ratio of females to males for spending less than $\\$100$ is in the first row. However, remember that we are actually interested in the other outcome – spending $\\$100$ or more. So we'll interpret this odds ratio as the odds of the row 2 value (males) compared to the odds of the row 1 value (females) of being in the second column. This interpretation is logically equivalent.\n",

    "$$ = \\frac{1}{1.54} = \\frac{101/139}{61/130}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you can use the odds ratio to measure the strength of association for a two-by-two table. The odds ratio of 0.6458 means that the odds of a male spending at least $\\$100$ are approximately $65\\%$, or $2/3$ that of a female. It's often easier to report odds ratios by converting the decimal value to a percent difference value. The formula for the conversion is\n",

    "Notice that the 95% confidence interval does not contain 0. This means that the positive, ordinal relationship between income level and purchasing habits is significant at the 0.05 significance level. The confidence bounds are valid only if the sample size is large. A general guideline is to have a sample size of at least 25 for each degree of freedom in the Pearson chi-square statistic. The asymptotic standard error is used for large samples and is used to calculate the confidence intervals for various measures of association, including the Spearman correlation coefficient. The asymptotic standard error measures the variability of the correlation statistic. In other words, it indicates how much error we can expect if we use the sample Spearman correlation to estimate the population Spearman correlation. "

    "\n",
    "In statistics, Yates' correction for continuity (or Yates' chi-squared test) is used in certain situations when testing for independence in a contingency table. In some cases, Yates' correction may adjust too far, and so its current use is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the chi-squared distribution to interpret Pearson's chi-squared statistic requires one to assume that the discrete probability of observed binomial frequencies in the table can be approximated by the continuous chi-squared distribution. This assumption is not quite correct, and introduces some error.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the error in approximation, Frank Yates, an English statistician, suggested a correction for continuity that adjusts the formula for Pearson's chi-squared test by subtracting 0.5 from the difference between each observed value and its expected value in a 2 × 2 contingency table. This reduces the chi-squared value obtained and thus increases its p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of Yates' correction is to prevent overestimation of statistical significance for small data. This formula is chiefly used when at least one cell of the table has an expected count smaller than 5. Unfortunately, Yates' correction may tend to overcorrect. **This can result in an overly conservative result that fails to reject the null hypothesis when it should (a type II error).** So it is suggested that Yates' correction is unnecessary even with quite low sample sizes, such as:\n",
