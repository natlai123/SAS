Errata for _Simulating Data with SAS_ by Rick Wicklin, 2013, SAS Press.

p. 156 	 The intermediate correlation is found in the interval [-1,1]. 
   	 The correct statements for the RandMVBinary function are:

         /* TYPO in first edition: search for root on [-1,1] */
         *R[j,k] = bisection(-1, 1);               /* pre-12.1 */
         R[j,k] = froot("MVBFunc", {-1 1});       /* 12.1 */

p. 162 	 The variable y should not be reassigned inside the ImanConoverTransform function.
   	 The correct statements in the DO loop are:

	 tmp = X[,i];       /* TYPO in first edition */
	 call sort(tmp);
	 X[,i] = tmp[rank];
